# 3DdepthPerceptionInBlender
This python script allows for creating 3D depth perception by creating the cameras overlayed in such a way that 2 images are slightly offset when too close to the viewer or very far away. Works whether you want to render images or render animation for VR, AR, and 3D monitor system.

In Blender, go to scripting and add a new text file and paste the create_cameras text and run the script. Save and then create a second text file and past the create_composites text there and run again for desire results. Make adjustments to scene if wanting to save frame by frame for a later animation file.
