# 3DdepthPerceptionInBlender
This python script allows for creating 3D depth perception by creating the cameras overlayed in such a way that 2 images are slightly offset when too close to the viewer or very far away. Works whether you want to render images or render animation for VR, AR, and 3D monitor system.
